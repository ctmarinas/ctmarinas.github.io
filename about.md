I am a software engineer/programmer/kernel hacker working for [Arm
Ltd](https://www.arm.com) in Cambridge, UK, involved mainly with Linux
activities and AArch64 (a.k.a. arm64) kernel port maintainance.

You can find me posting on the [Arm Linux kernel mailing
list](http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-arm-kernel) (and
occasionally on the #armlinux IRC channel) or
[playing](http://www.dragongoserver.net/userinfo.php?uid=2240)
[Go](http://www.britgo.org/).

Apart from Linux, C and Arm assembly, I have a general interest in other
programming languages (Python, Haskell, Lisp, C++, Prolog) and formal
modelling (TLA+, CBMC).
